# Codility-Distinct
Write a function</br>
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</br>
that, given an array A consisting of N integers,</br> 
returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:</br>
A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1</br>
A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1</br>
the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A,</br> 
namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</br>
N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];</br>
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
